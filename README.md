# Digital Art Generator

A simple Python script to generate abstract digital art. This project uses the `Pillow` library to create random digital artworks with lines, circles, and rectangles.

## Installation

To use the digital art generator, you first need to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sonnymay/digital-art-generator.git
cd digital-art-generator
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python digital_art_generator.py
```

By default, this will create a file named `generated_art.png` in your current directory. Every time you run the script, a new unique piece of art will be generated.

## Customization

You can easily modify the `digital_art_generator.py` script to adjust the randomness, add new shapes, or change the canvas size to better suit your needs.
